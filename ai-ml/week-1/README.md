## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Week 1 of the AI/ML Development Track This week, you'll build a fraud detection system for our Point of Sale (PoS) application. You'll use Google Colab for development, find a suitable dataset, and implement various machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

## 2. Why ML for Fraud Detection?

Traditionally businesses relied on rules alone to block fraudulent payments. Today, rules are still an important part of the anti-fraud toolkit but in the past, using them on their own also caused some issues.

**False positives**: Using lots of rules tends to result in a high number of false positives - meaning you’re likely to block a lot of genuine customers. For example, high-value orders and orders from high-risk locations are more likely to be fraudulent. But if you enable a rule which blocks all transactions over $500 or every payment from a risky region, you’ll lose out on lots of genuine customers’ business too.

**Fixed outcomes**: The thresholds for fraudy behaviour can change over time - if your prices change, the average order value can go up, meaning that orders over $500 become the norm, and so rules can become invalid. Rules are also based on absolute yes/no answers, so don’t allow you to adjust the outcome or judge where a payment sits on the risk scale.

**Inefficient and hard to scale**: Using a rules-only approach means that your library must keep expanding as fraud evolves. This makes the system slower and puts a heavy maintenance burden on your fraud analyst team, demanding increasing numbers of manual reviews. Fraudsters are always working on smarter, faster and more stealthy ways to commit fraud online. Today, criminals use sophisticated methods to steal enhanced customer data and impersonate genuine customers, making it even more difficult for rules based on typical fraud accounts to detect this kind of behaviour.

Machine learning can often be more effective than humans at uncovering non-intuitive patterns or subtle trends which might only be obvious to a fraud analyst much later Machine learning models are able to learn from patterns of normal behavior. They are very fast to adapt to changes in that normal behaviour and can quickly identify patterns of fraud transactions.

## 8. FAQ

Q: How do I choose between different algorithms?
A: Start with simpler models (e.g., Logistic Regression) and progressively try more complex ones, comparing their performance.

Q: Is it necessary to complete all optional tasks?
A: No, focus on core tasks first. Optional tasks are for those who finish early or want extra challenges.
