## 5. Detailed Task Breakdown

### 5.1 Develop a Machine Learning Pipeline

A machine learning pipeline is a sequence of data processing components that automate the workflow of a machine learning system. For our fraud detection system, we'll create a pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Example pipeline structure:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier())
])

# Later, you can fit and predict using the pipeline
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

This structure allows you to chain multiple steps together, making your workflow more organized and easier to maintain.

### 5.2 Data Preprocessing with Pandas

Data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring that our models receive clean, well-structured data. We'll use Pandas for this step.

Key preprocessing tasks include:
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical variables to numerical
- Normalizing or standardizing numerical features

Example preprocessing code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

def preprocess_data(df):
    # Handle missing values
    df = df.fillna(df.mean())
    
    # Convert categorical variables
    le = LabelEncoder()
    categorical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
    for col in categorical_columns:
        df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])
    
    # Normalize numerical features
    numerical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']).columns
    df[numerical_columns] = (df[numerical_columns] - df[numerical_columns].mean()) / df[numerical_columns].std()
    
    return df

# Usage
df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')
preprocessed_df = preprocess_data(df)
```

### 5.3 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing data to improve model performance. We'll use both manual techniques and automated feature engineering with Featuretools.

Manual feature engineering example:

```python
def engineer_features(df):
    # Create a 'transaction_hour' feature
    df['transaction_hour'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_datetime']).dt.hour
    
    # Create a 'is_weekend' feature
    df['is_weekend'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_datetime']).dt.dayofweek.isin([5, 6]).astype(int)
    
    # Create a 'transaction_amount_to_balance_ratio' feature
    df['transaction_amount_to_balance_ratio'] = df['transaction_amount'] / df['account_balance']
    
    return df

# Usage
engineered_df = engineer_features(preprocessed_df)
```

Automated feature engineering with Featuretools:

```python
import featuretools as ft

def automated_feature_engineering(df):
    # Create an entity set
    es = ft.EntitySet(id="transactions")
    
    # Add the main entity
    es = es.add_dataframe(
        dataframe_name="transactions",
        dataframe=df,
        index="transaction_id",
        time_index="transaction_datetime"
    )
    
    # Run deep feature synthesis
    feature_matrix, feature_defs = ft.dfs(
        entityset=es,
        target_dataframe_name="transactions",
        trans_primitives=["day", "month", "year", "weekday", "is_weekend"],
        agg_primitives=["sum", "mean", "max", "min", "std"],
        max_depth=2
    )
    
    return feature_matrix

# Usage
final_df = automated_feature_engineering(engineered_df)
```

### 5.4 Addressing Class Imbalance

Fraud detection datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where the number of legitimate transactions far outweighs the number of fraudulent ones. We'll use techniques from imbalanced-learn to address this issue.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline as ImbPipeline

def balance_dataset(X, y):
    # Define samplers
    over = SMOTE(sampling_strategy=0.1)
    under = RandomUnderSampler(sampling_strategy=0.5)
    
    # Create a pipeline
    steps = [('o', over), ('u', under)]
    pipeline = ImbPipeline(steps=steps)
    
    # Fit and resample
    X_resampled, y_resampled = pipeline.fit_resample(X, y)
    
    return X_resampled, y_resampled

# Usage
X_balanced, y_balanced = balance_dataset(X, y)
```

### 5.5 Implementing Classification Algorithms

We'll implement and compare multiple classification algorithms to find the best performer for our fraud detection task.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import xgboost as xgb
import lightgbm as lgb

def train_models(X, y):
    models = {
        'Logistic Regression (L1)': LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', solver='liblinear'),
        'Logistic Regression (L2)': LogisticRegression(penalty='l2'),
        'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(),
        'XGBoost': xgb.XGBClassifier(),
        'LightGBM': lgb.LGBMClassifier(),
        'SVM': SVC(probability=True)
    }
    
    for name, model in models.items():
        model.fit(X, y)
        print(f"Trained {name}")
    
    return models

# Usage
trained_models = train_models(X_balanced, y_balanced)
```

### 5.6 Model Evaluation

We'll use various metrics to evaluate our models, focusing on those most relevant to fraud detection.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, roc_auc_score, classification_report

def evaluate_models(models, X_test, y_test):
    for name, model in models.items():
        y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
        y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
        
        # Calculate metrics
        precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_pred_proba)
        auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)
        
        print(f"\nModel: {name}")
        print(f"AUC-ROC: {auc_roc:.4f}")
        print("Classification Report:")
        print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Usage
evaluate_models(trained_models, X_test, y_test)
```

### 5.7 Model Interpretability with SHAP

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help us understand the impact of each feature on model predictions.

```python
import shap

def interpret_model(model, X):
    explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)
    
    # Plot summary
    shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X)
    
    # Plot individual prediction
    shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0,:], X.iloc[0,:])

# Usage (assuming Random Forest is our best model)
best_model = trained_models['Random Forest']
interpret_model(best_model, X_test)
```

### 5.8 Creating a Real-time Fraud Detection API

Finally, we'll create an API to serve our fraud detection model in real-time.

Using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import joblib

app = FastAPI()

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('best_model.joblib')

class Transaction(BaseModel):
    # Define your transaction features here
    amount: float
    merchant_id: int
    # ... other features

@app.post("/predict")
def predict_fraud(transaction: Transaction):
    # Convert input to feature array
    features = [transaction.amount, transaction.merchant_id, ...]  # Add all features
    
    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict([features])[0]
    probability = model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
    
    return {
        "is_fraudulent": bool(prediction),
        "fraud_probability": float(probability)
    }

# Run with: uvicorn app:app --reload
```
